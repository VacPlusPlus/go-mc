# NBT [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/VacPlusPlus/go-mc/nbt.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/VacPlusPlus/go-mc/nbt)
This package implement the [Named Binary Tag](https://wiki.vg/NBT) format of Minecraft. 

The API is very similar to the  standard library `encoding/json`. If you (high probability) have used that, it is easy to use this.

# Basic Usage
>  I don't know why `Marshal` looks like that, and **I will change it** to `func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error)`.
> **Use `Encoder` is recommended now.**

For the following NBT tag:

```
TAG_Compound("hello world") {
    TAG_String("name"): "Bananrama"
}   
```

To read and write would look like:

```go
package main

import "bytes"
import "github.com/VacPlusPlus/go-mc/nbt"

type Compound struct {
    Name string `nbt:"name"` // The field must be started with the capital letter
}

func main() {
    var out bytes.Buffer
    banana := Compound{Name: "Bananrama"}
    _ = nbt.Marshal(&out, banana)

    var rama Compound
    _ = nbt.Unmarshal(out.Bytes(), &rama)
}
```



# Struct field tags

There are two tags supported:
- nbt
- nbt_type

The `nbt` tag is used to change the name of the NBT Tag field, whereas the `nbt_type`
 tag is used to enforce a certain NBT Tag type when it is ambiguous.

For example:
```go
type Compound struct {
    LongArray []int64
    LongList []int64 `nbt_type:"list"` // forces a long list instead of a long array
}
```
